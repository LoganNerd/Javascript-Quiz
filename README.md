# Javascript-Quiz
Creating a javascript quiz!


In this project we were given the task of creating a Javascript quiz to test our knowledge on JS elements. I first defined which questions I would be asking and setup 2 for loops to cycle through my question and anwser array. I created a score function that tracks a users score and stores it in the local storage, each correct anwser rewards you with 1 point. Below you can see the functioning quiz!
